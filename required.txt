AI = The big goal → make machines intelligent.
ML = One approach to AI → learning from data.
NNs = A powerful technique within ML → inspired by the brain, used in deep learning.


1. Artificial Intelligence

intellectual-ухаантай, сэтгэдэг


The definition
The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans

AI can be simple or complex


1. Artificial Intelligence

Definition: The broadest field. AI is the science of making machines capable of tasks that normally require human intelligence.
Goal: To create systems that can think, reason, learn, and act intelligently.

Examples:
Chess-playing computer (Deep Blue)
Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
Self-driving cars

Think of AI as the "big umbrella" covering all methods that make machines smar




2. Machine Learning
Definition: A subset of AI. It focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed with rules.

How it works: The system improves its performance as it gets more data.

Rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us

Examples:

Spam email filtering
Movie recommendation systems (Netflix)
Predicting house prices

So, ML is one way to achieve AI.





3.  Neural Networks or Deep Learning

Definition: A subset of Machine Learning, inspired by the human brain.

easy ==> a form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data


Structure: Composed of layers of “neurons” (nodes) connected by weights.
Specialty: Very good at recognizing patterns (images, speech, natural language).

Examples:

Face recognition on Facebook
Google Translate (language translation)
ChatGPT (built on large neural networks)

Neural networks are like the "engine" powering many modern ML applications, especially Deep Learning (neural networks with many layers).

data is most important thing


Layer in Machine Learning
In machine learning, especially in neural networks / deep learning, a layer is a collection of nodes (neurons) that perform a specific transformation on input data.
        Input Layer: Takes raw data as input.
        Hidden Layer(s): Processes data through weighted connections and activation functions.
        Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or output.

Key Points:
        Each layer transforms data from the previous layer.
        More layers → deeper network → potentially more complex patterns can be learned.
        Types of layers:
                Dense / Fully Connected Layer: Each neuron connects to every neuron in the next layer.
                Convolutional Layer (CNN): Extracts features from images.
                Recurrent Layer (RNN): Processes sequential data
