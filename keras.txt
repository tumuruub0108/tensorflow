# what is Dense
In TensorFlow / Keras, a Dense layer is the most common type of layer in a neural network. Itâ€™s also called a fully connected layer

ðŸ”¹ What it does
    A Dense layer connects every input neuron to every output neuron.
    Mathematically, it performs:
        y=xW+b
    where:
        x = input vector
        W = weight matrix (learned during training)
        b = bias vector
        y = output vector


# When to use a Sequential model
A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

A Sequential model is like a straight line of blocks.
Each block (layer) gets one input.
Each block gives one output.
Data just goes: Input â†’ Layer 1 â†’ Layer 2 â†’ â€¦ â†’ Output.


# A Sequential model is not appropriate when:
    Your model has multiple inputs or multiple outputs
    Any of your layers has multiple inputs or multiple outputs
    You need to do layer sharing
    You want non-linear topology (e.g. a residual connection, a multi-branch model)



# Specifying the input shape in advance
Generally, all layers in Keras need to know the shape of their inputs in order to be able to create their weights. So when you create a layer like this, initially, it has no weights:
