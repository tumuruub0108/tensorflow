# TensorFlow Core Learning Algorithms
In this notebook we will walk through 4 fundemental machine learning algorithms. We will apply each of these algorithms to unique problems and datasets before highlighting the use cases of each.

The algorithms we will focus on include:

Linear Regression
Classification
Clustering
Hidden Markov Models

It is worth noting that there are many tools within TensorFlow that could be used to solve the problems we will see below. I have chosen the tools that I belive give the most variety and are easiest to use.

# Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.

In this tutorial we will use a linear model to predict the survival rate of passangers from the titanic dataset.

This section is based on the following documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear


# How it Works
Before we dive in, I will provide a very surface level explination of the linear regression algorithm.

Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values.

Let's take an example of a data set with one feature and one label.
